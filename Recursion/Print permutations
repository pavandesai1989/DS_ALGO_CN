Given an input string (STR), print all possible permutations of the input string.
Note:
The input string may contain the same characters, so there will also be the same permutations.
The order of permutations doesnâ€™t matter.
Input Format:
The only input line contains a string (STR) of alphabets in lower case
Output Format:
Print each permutations in a new line
Note:
You do not need to print anything, it has already been taken care of. Just implement the function.  

#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

void printPermutations(string input){

    	/* Don't write main() function.
	 * Don't read input, it is passed as function argument.
	 * Print output as specified in the question
	*/
}
