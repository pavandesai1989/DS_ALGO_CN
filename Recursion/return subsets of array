Given an integer array (of length n), find and print all the subsets of input array.
Subsets are of length varying from 0 to n, that contain elements of the array. But the order of elements should remain same as in the input array.
Note : The order of subsets are not important. Just print the subsets in different lines.
Input format :
Line 1 : Integer n, Size of array
Line 2 : Array elements (separated by space)


void printSubsetsOfArray(int input[], int size)
{
	// Write your code here
    if( size == 0) return;
    
}
